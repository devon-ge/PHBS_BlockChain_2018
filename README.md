# Social platform attention, sentiment and Bitcoin price volatility

## 1. Introduction

Bitcoin is the first public digital currency and created in 2009. Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency. Bitcoin is well-known to the public 4 years after its creation when it reached $1,000 in December, 2013. From 2014 to the very beginning of 2017, the price of Bitcoin fluctuate between $200-$1,000. According to existing research, Bitcoin's value is much more volatile than fiat currencies like USD, EURO, GBP and Japanese Yen. The extreme volatility reduces the probability of Bitcoin to be an ideal currency. Furthermore, Bitcoin's price and its attention on social platform increased sharply during the year 2017. The price peaked in Decemer 2017, with the highest price exceeding $20,000. However, the price dramatically plummeted over 50% in 2 months after it reached the peak. Most time in February 2018, Bitcoin price is below $10,000. Now the price of Bitcoin is about $5,200. Figure 1 shows the price over the 5 years.

As a speculative asset, social platform attention reflect how popular bitcoin is. Intuitively, when people are optimistic about Bitcoin, the probability of an increase in Bitcoin price is higher due to the speculative buying. Figure 2 shows the Google trends in the past 5 years.

## 2. Literature Review

The existing literature has done extensive research on the impact of Twitter, Google trends etc. on Bitcoin price. For example, Mai et al. (2015) find that the numbers of bullish and bearish tweets by all users have negligible effects on bitcoin returns in the next hour. Matta et al. (2015) use Google trends to analyze Bitcoin’s popularity under the perspective of Web search. Their cross-correlation analysis between Bitcoin price and Google trends yields positively significant and substantial results. Thus, Google trends can be seen as a predicator for Bitcoin price. Georgoula et al. (2015) treat Tweets sentiment as independent variable and use ordinary least squares model to analyze the impact of sentiment on Bitcoin price formation. The sentiment analysis is conducted through support vector machines, which classifies the sentiment.Their findings also support the argument that high public recognition or interest in Bitcoins increases their market price.

Apart from the price level, volatility of Bitcoin is increasingly attracting the academia. Bukovina and Marticek (2016) decompose Bitcoin price into two parts: rational and less rational components. They exmaine the sentiment as a driver of Bitcoin volatility and find that positive sentiment influences much more on Bitcoin volatility. Stenqvist and Lönnö (2017) analyze 2.27 million Bitcoin-related tweets to examine the relationship between sentiment fluctuation and price change in very near future. They use different time interval to test the correlation and find that shorter intervals (5 mins and 15 mins) produce more predictions, with sentiment change of 2%.
